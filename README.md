# Advent of Code

## General information
My solution for Advent of Code, written in C# as a Console Application. There are also some PowerShell scripts to help with automating documentation. No other technologies are used.

## Where to find the solutions?
The solutions to each year are in their own folder under Challenge Solutions. Below you can find some useful links to both the Advent of Code years on the website, as well as my solutions:
