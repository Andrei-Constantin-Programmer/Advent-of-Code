## General information
My solution for Advent of Code, written in C# and F# as a Console Application. There are also some PowerShell scripts to help with automating documentation. No other technologies are used.

## Where to find the solutions?
The solutions to each year are in their own folder under Challenge Solutions. Below you can find some useful links to both the Advent of Code years on the website, as well as my solutions:

## Launching the program
* Clone the solution.  
* Run the Advent of Code project.  
* You can now interact with the terminal  
* You will be asked to enter the language (leave empty for C#), year, and then day for which you want the solution. Enter a value for the year and the day (of the Advent), hit enter, and the solution will be shown on the terminal (if it exists). You can enter `q` or `quit` the current menu.
